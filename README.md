# Java Chess

- Following an example on Youtube by **Software Architecture & Design**
- Link to first installment >> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8fSdSUKttk&amp;index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8fSdSUKttk&amp;index=2)
- Using to get exposure to complex program design and further deepen my Java knowledge/skillset
- Thus far most of my experience has come from building small scale web apps
- I want to expand on that skillset by being a better programmer in a general sense
- (And so far it's been fun)


## New concepts learned so far/ Progress/ Notes/ Thoughts:

- Creating an immutable map
- Logical process for deciding legal moves for the `Knight`
- ^^ Looking to try to write some overridden `calculateLegalMoves` methods prior to seeing solution
- ^^ Was able to identify pattern of CANDIDATE_MOVE_VECTOR_COORDINATES 
for Rook, Queen, and King and implement their respective `calculateLegalMoves` methods prior to 
solution exposure :)
- I've found the concept of creating a new board upon each move interesting
- Really trying to wrap my head around the profound use of immutability in this example
- I own a copy of "Effective Java" and will be reading it with more intentionality after seeing the use of its concepts
in this particular program design
