# Java Chess

- Following an example on Youtube by **Software Architecture & Design**
- Link to first installment >> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8fSdSUKttk&amp;index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8fSdSUKttk&amp;index=2)
- Using to get exposure to complex program design and further deepen my Java knowledge/skillset
- Thus far most of my experience has come from building small scale web apps
- I want to expand on that skillset by being a better programmer in a general sense
- (And so far it's been fun)


## New concepts learned so far:

- Creating an immutable map
- Logical process for deciding legal moves for the `Knight`
- ^^ Looking to try to write some overridden `calculateLegalMoves` methods prior to seeing solution
